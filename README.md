# Amoy-XNAV
This repository contains all the shell scripts and supplementary codes developed during my summer internship at IIST for the project XNAV.


This project focuses on developing an X-ray Pulsar-Based Navigation (XNAV) system for autonomous spacecraft. By utilizing the stable periodic X-ray emissions from pulsars, XNAV presents a promising alternative to traditional ground-based navigation. This repository includes research, algorithms, and simulations related to XNAV, covering:

- Pulsar data acquisition and processing
- X-ray signal detection and analysis

The prerequisites include downloading and callibrating HEAsoft:
